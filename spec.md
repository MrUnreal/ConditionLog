# Rental Condition Reporter — Full Project Breakdown
## AI-Powered Move-In/Move-Out Property Documentation App

---

## CRITICAL COMPETITOR DISCLOSURE

**DepositGuard** (depositguard.com) — a UK-based startup (registered in England & Wales) is building essentially this idea. HOWEVER:
- **Still pre-launch** (waitlist only, no shipped product as of Feb 2026)
- **UK-only** (references UK deposit schemes, tenancy law, letting agents)
- **No AI features** — just photos + notes → PDF
- **No move-in vs move-out comparison**
- **No damage detection**
- **Their existence validates the market** — someone else saw the same gap

**Our differentiation (and why there's still a massive gap):**
1. **US-first** — 44M rental leases/year vs ~4.5M in UK. 10x bigger market with zero equivalent tool. US has state-by-state deposit laws (50 different rule sets)
2. **AI-powered damage detection** — auto-identify scratches, stains, cracks, mold from photos
3. **Move-in vs Move-out COMPARISON ENGINE** — the killer feature. Overlay photos of the same spot, AI highlights what changed
4. **Dispute letter generation** — AI generates formal dispute letter from your evidence
5. **Cross-platform web + mobile** from day 1 (DepositGuard appears web-only)
6. **During-tenancy maintenance documentation** — not just endpoints, but the whole tenancy lifecycle

## PRODUCT VISION (Refined)

### One-liner
"Your digital witness for every rental — AI-powered property condition documentation that protects your deposit."

### The Core Problem (Deep)
The average US renter loses $200-$600 per move due to disputed deposit deductions. The current "solution" is:
1. Take random photos on your phone (unorganized, no metadata proof)
2. Hope you remember what things looked like months/years later
3. Get into he-said-she-said argument with landlord
4. Give up because you have no structured evidence

**The deeper insight:** It's not that renters don't care — it's that creating structured evidence is a chore nobody does properly because the tools don't exist. If you make it a 10-minute guided walkthrough, people WILL do it because $1,200 is on the line.

### Target User
- **Primary:** US renters aged 22-40 (college students, young professionals, families)
- **Secondary:** Roommates in shared apartments
- **Tertiary:** Property managers who want documentation (B2B expansion later)
- **TAM:** 44M rental leases signed annually in the US. Average deposit: $1,200.

### Revenue Model
- **Free tier:** 1 property, basic photo documentation, watermarked PDF
- **Pay-per-report:** $4.99 per professional move-in OR move-out report (one-time purchase)
- **Pro subscription:** $5.99/mo or $29.99/yr — unlimited properties, AI damage detection, comparison reports, dispute letter generator, cloud storage
- **Revenue math:** If 0.1% of US movers (44M/yr) pay $4.99 per report = $220K/yr. At 1% = $2.2M/yr.

### My Recommendation
**ConditionLog** — `.com` available for $6.79 + X handle available. Clear, descriptive, SEO-friendly, professional. Says exactly what the app does. Easy to spell over the phone. Works as both a noun ("your condition log") and a verb ("condition-log your apartment").

**Runner-up: MoveLedger** — `.com` available for $6.79. Professional, trustworthy sound. Implies documentation and accountability. Slightly less descriptive of the core function.

## PHASED PROJECT BREAKDOWN
### For an Agentic Coding Implementation

---

### PHASE 0: Foundation & Setup (Day 1-2)
**Goal:** Project scaffolding, CI/CD, design system

**Tasks for coding agent:**
```
0.1 Initialize monorepo with Turborepo (apps/web, apps/mobile, packages/shared)
0.2 Set up Next.js 14+ app with App Router (apps/web)
0.3 Set up Expo/React Native project (apps/mobile)
0.4 Configure Supabase project (auth, database, storage buckets)
0.5 Set up Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui component library
0.6 Configure ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode
0.7 Set up Vercel deployment (web) + EAS Build (mobile)
0.8 Create shared types/schemas package (packages/shared)
0.9 Set up environment variable management (.env.local, Vercel env)
0.10 Initialize Git repo with conventional commits
```

**Database schema (initial):**
```sql

  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  property_id UUID REFERENCES properties(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  report_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (report_type IN ('move_in', 'move_out', 'maintenance')),

);
```

---

### PHASE 1: MVP Core — Guided Walkthrough + PDF Report (Week 1-2)
**Goal:** User can create a property, walk through rooms, take photos, add notes, generate a basic PDF report

**Tasks for coding agent:**
```
1.1 Auth flow: email/password + Google OAuth via Supabase Auth
1.2 Onboarding: create property form (address, landlord info, lease dates, deposit amount)
1.3 Dashboard: list of properties + reports per property
1.4 "New Report" flow: choose Move-In or Move-Out type
1.5 Room setup: add rooms from template list (Kitchen, Bathroom, Bedroom 1, Living Room, Entry, Garage, Patio, Closet, Laundry, Other)
1.6 Room walkthrough UI: swipeable room-by-room interface
1.7 Photo capture: camera integration with auto-timestamp + geolocation metadata
1.8 Photo annotation: add text notes per photo, drag-to-highlight areas
1.9 Photo upload: compress + upload to Supabase Storage with progress indicator
1.10 Room notes: general notes field per room
1.11 Report summary: review all rooms + photos before finalizing
1.12 "Complete Report" action: locks report, timestamps it
1.13 PDF generation: server-side PDF creation with all photos, notes, timestamps, geolocation
1.14 PDF export: download + email to self
1.15 Share link: generate secure shareable URL for the report
1.16 Responsive web design (works on phone browsers too, not just native app)
```

**Key UX details for the agent:**
- The walkthrough should feel like a guided checklist, NOT a blank canvas
- Pre-populate rooms with smart defaults based on property type
- Show a progress bar: "5 of 8 rooms documented"
- Each room should have a suggested checklist of what to photograph (walls, ceiling, floor, fixtures, appliances, windows, outlets)
- Photos should be capturable in-app (not just file upload) to guarantee timestamp integrity
- The PDF must look professional — clean layout, property address header, timestamp footer, page numbers

---

### PHASE 2: AI Enhancement — Damage Detection + Smart Descriptions (Week 3-4)
**Goal:** AI analyzes photos to detect damage, generate descriptions, and rate severity

**Tasks for coding agent:**
```
2.1 AI damage detection endpoint: send photo to OpenAI Vision API / Claude Vision
2.2 Prompt engineering for damage classification: scratches, stains, cracks, mold, holes, burns, water damage, scuffs, chips, dents
2.3 Severity scoring: minor (normal wear and tear), moderate (questionable), severe (clearly beyond normal use)
2.4 AI-generated damage descriptions: "Small scratch on hardwood floor near doorway, approximately 6 inches long. Consistent with normal furniture movement."
2.5 Photo quality checker: detect blur, darkness, finger over lens — prompt user to retake
2.6 Batch processing: analyze all photos in a report asynchronously
2.7 AI results UI: show damage labels overlaid on photos, severity badges
2.8 Override mechanism: user can accept, reject, or edit AI findings
2.9 "Wear and tear" classifier: AI distinguishes between normal wear and tenant damage (crucial for disputes)
2.10 Smart room suggestions: based on photos already taken, suggest what else to document
```

**AI prompt strategy:**
```
System: You are an expert property condition assessor. Analyze this photo of a rental property room. Identify any damage, wear, or condition issues visible. For each issue found:
1. Type (scratch, stain, crack, mold, hole, water_damage, scuff, chip, dent, discoloration, other)
2. Severity (minor = normal wear and tear, moderate = debatable, severe = clear damage)
3. Location in photo (top-left, center, bottom-right, etc.)
4. Description in plain English suitable for a formal condition report
5. Whether this would typically be considered "normal wear and tear" under standard US rental law

If no issues are found, explicitly state "No visible damage or issues detected."

Respond in JSON format.
```

---

### PHASE 3: Comparison Engine — Move-In vs Move-Out (Week 5-6)
**Goal:** Compare photos from move-in and move-out, highlight changes, generate comparison report

**Tasks for coding agent:**
```
3.1 Photo matching UI: side-by-side view of move-in and move-out photos for same room
3.2 Manual photo pairing: user can drag-and-match which photos correspond
3.3 Auto-suggestion: AI suggests which photos likely show the same area based on visual similarity
3.4 Side-by-side comparison view: synchronized zoom/pan on both photos
3.5 AI diff analysis: "What changed between these two photos?"
3.6 Diff overlay generation: highlight areas that changed between the two photos
3.7 Change severity scoring: "no change", "minor change (wear and tear)", "significant change (potential deduction)"
3.8 Comparison report PDF: side-by-side photos with AI analysis per pair
3.9 Summary dashboard: "X rooms documented, Y changes detected, Z potential dispute items"
3.10 Timeline view: see property condition over all reports chronologically
```

**This is the KILLER FEATURE.** No competitor does this. The output is a visual diff that makes dispute arguments trivial:
- Left: move-in photo with clean wall
- Right: move-out photo with same wall, still clean
- AI annotation: "No significant changes detected. Any minor discoloration is consistent with normal wear and tear over [lease duration]."

OR conversely:
- Left: move-in photo showing existing scratch
- Right: move-out photo showing same scratch
- AI annotation: "This scratch was present at move-in. Any deduction for this damage would be inappropriate based on documented pre-existing condition."

---

### PHASE 4: Legal Tools + Dispute Engine (Week 7-8)
**Goal:** Help users understand their rights and generate dispute documentation

**Tasks for coding agent:**
```
4.1 State-by-state deposit law database: all 50 US states + DC deposit rules
    - Maximum deposit amount
    - Return deadline (14-30 days varies by state)
    - Required itemized statement
    - Penalties for late return (some states award 2x-3x damages)
    - Normal wear and tear definition
    - Required pre-move-out inspection rights
4.2 "Know Your Rights" page per state: auto-detected from property address
4.3 Deposit return deadline calculator: based on state law + lease end date
4.4 Countdown timer: "Your landlord has 14 days remaining to return your deposit"
4.5 AI dispute letter generator: formal letter based on your evidence + state law
4.6 Letter templates: initial demand, follow-up, small claims court filing preparation
4.7 Deduction tracker: itemize each deduction the landlord made, mark as disputed/accepted
4.8 Evidence package export: combined PDF with comparison photos + dispute letter + state law references
4.9 Landlord communication log: record all interactions about the deposit
4.10 Small claims court checklist: step-by-step guide for filing (by state)
```

**Dispute letter generation prompt:**
```
Generate a formal deposit dispute letter using the following data:
- Tenant name, property address, lease dates
- Deposit amount paid: $X
- Amount returned: $Y
- Landlord's claimed deductions: [list]
- Tenant's evidence: [photo comparison summaries]
- State law: [relevant statutes]
- Tone: firm but professional, citing specific evidence and law

Output a complete letter ready to send.
```

---

### PHASE 5: Growth Engine + Monetization (Week 9-12)
**Goal:** Payment integration, marketing site, viral mechanics, analytics

**Tasks for coding agent:**
```
MONETIZATION:
5.1 Stripe integration: one-time report purchases ($4.99) + subscriptions ($5.99/mo, $29.99/yr)
5.2 Paywall logic: free tier (1 property, watermarked PDF, no AI) vs paid tiers
5.3 In-app purchase flow (mobile): Apple IAP + Google Play Billing
5.4 Upgrade prompts at natural moments (when AI finds damage, when generating comparison report)

MARKETING SITE:
5.5 Landing page: hero section, feature showcase, testimonials, pricing table, CTA
5.6 SEO pages: "how to get your deposit back in [State]" for all 50 states (programmatic SEO)
5.7 Blog section: "5 things to photograph before your landlord tries to keep your deposit"
5.8 Deposit return calculator widget: embeddable, drives traffic
5.9 Social proof: running counter of "deposits protected" / "reports generated"

VIRAL MECHANICS:
5.10 "Protected by [AppName]" badge on shared reports — recipients see the brand
5.11 Referral program: share with a friend, both get 1 free report
5.12 Roommate invite: "Invite your roommates to this property" — multi-user per property
5.13 Social sharing templates: "I documented my apartment in 10 minutes" with before/after screenshots
5.14 End-of-lease reminder emails: "Your lease ends in 30 days — time to create your move-out report"

ANALYTICS:
5.15 PostHog or Mixpanel integration: funnel tracking, feature usage
5.16 Key metrics dashboard: sign-ups, reports created, reports completed, PDFs exported, conversions
5.17 A/B testing framework for paywall placement and pricing
```

---

### PHASE 6: Polish + App Store Launch (Week 13-14)
**Goal:** App store submissions, performance optimization, edge cases

**Tasks for coding agent:**
```
6.1 App Store submission: screenshots, app preview video, description, keywords
6.2 Google Play submission: listing, feature graphic, privacy policy
6.3 App Store Optimization (ASO): keywords targeting "deposit", "move in checklist", "rental inspection", "apartment condition report"
6.4 Performance optimization: image compression, lazy loading, offline support
6.5 Offline mode: take photos and notes offline, sync when connected
6.6 Push notification scheduling: monthly property check reminders, lease-end countdown
6.7 Accessibility audit: screen reader support, color contrast, touch targets
6.8 Privacy policy + Terms of Service pages
6.9 GDPR/CCPA compliance: data export, data deletion
6.10 Error handling + crash reporting (Sentry)
6.11 Rate limiting + abuse prevention
6.12 Load testing: ensure PDF generation handles concurrent requests
```

---

## MARKETING STRATEGY (Detailed)

### Pre-Launch (Weeks 1-4 while building)
1. **Create landing page** with email capture: "Protect your next deposit. Join the waitlist."
2. **Reddit presence** — genuinely help people in:
   - r/legaladvice (deposit dispute posts appear daily)
   - r/apartments, r/renters, r/TenantHelp
   - r/personalfinance (deposit is a financial topic)
   - r/college (first-time renters)
3. **TikTok account** — start posting educational content NOW:
   - "5 things to photograph before moving in"
   - "Your landlord is legally required to return your deposit within X days in [state]"
   - "POV: You documented everything and your landlord can't keep a dime"
   - "Things your landlord hopes you don't know about your deposit"
4. **Blog/SEO** — target long-tail keywords:
   - "how to get security deposit back" (12K monthly searches)
   - "move in condition report template" (2K monthly searches)
   - "normal wear and tear apartment" (8K monthly searches)
   - "landlord keeping deposit unfairly" (3K monthly searches)
   - Create a free printable checklist (lead magnet)

### Launch (Week 5-6)
5. **Product Hunt launch** — prep a killer video demo, line up upvotes from beta users
6. **Hacker News Show HN** — "I built an AI app to stop landlords from stealing deposits"
7. **Reddit launch posts** — r/SideProject, r/InternetIsBeautiful, r/CozyPlaces
8. **Free reports for beta users** — first 1,000 users get lifetime free for feedback

### Post-Launch Growth (Week 7+)
9. **Seasonal content pushes:**
   - May-June: "Lease renewal season" content
   - August-September: "Back to college" content (first-time renters)
   - Year-round: "Moving day" content
10. **Partnership outreach:**
    - College housing offices (they'd LOVE to share this with students)
    - Tenant rights organizations
    - Moving companies (referral partnerships)
    - Real estate agents (some represent renters)
11. **App Store Optimization:** Iterate on keywords, screenshot designs, description A/B testing
12. **Press outreach:** "New app uses AI to fight unfair deposit deductions" — tech blogs, consumer advocacy press
13. **Programmatic SEO:** Generate pages for "security deposit laws in [State]" for all 50 states — each page links to the app

### Content Calendar (Ongoing)
| Platform | Frequency | Content Type |

## AGENT HANDOFF INSTRUCTIONS

When handing this project to a coding agent (Cursor, Copilot, etc.), give it ONE phase at a time. For each phase:

1. **Start with the database schema** — have the agent create migrations first
2. **Build the API layer** — server actions (Next.js) or API routes
3. **Build the UI** — one screen at a time, starting with the critical path
4. **Write tests** — at minimum, test the PDF generation and payment flows
5. **Deploy** — after each phase ships, deploy to staging

**Critical instruction for the agent:** "You are building a rental property condition documentation app. The core workflow is: User creates property → Starts move-in report → Adds rooms → Takes photos per room with notes → AI analyzes photos for damage → User completes report → PDF is generated with all evidence. Every photo must have an immutable timestamp and geolocation. The PDF must be professional enough to submit in a legal dispute."
